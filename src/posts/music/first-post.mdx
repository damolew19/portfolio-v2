Today is Friday. Here's my recap of the past few days. I've created two folders titled Portraits and Analogue Attic, where the first represents pieces inspired from Seb Wildblood's music style. The later resembles music of the Australian Label Analogue Attic.

## Session View

I've decided to utilize the session view feature found in Ableton to begin each project. My initial intention is to use these view as a store of place for cool instruments which can be used throughout the project. When the project complete, this file can then be used as the live version to play out these songs. The clips very essential to be stored as the purpose of this parent like file is to only store instruments. 


## Making of my first track...

I did somewhat struggle in making my first track. I went for a walk this afternoon, listening to what I have made. I intended the track to be likened to that of Seb Wildbloods SoundCloud Mix (I know the one), where it would be optimal to play this tune, cruising around Melbourne city on a warm Autumns night.


## Where from here...

So I have two more days to finish this track. My plan is to restart the track from scratch and focus on elements I enjoy from the Seb Wildblood mix.
